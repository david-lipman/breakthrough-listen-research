# The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Searching Boyajian’s Star for Laser Line Emission
I was lead author of the paper "The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Searching Boyajian’s Star for Laser Line Emission," which got published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP) in March 2019. This research was conducted largely using Python and associated packages NumPy, SciPy, and Matploblib.

## Abstract
Boyajian’ s Star (KIC 8462852) has received significant attention due to its unusual periodic brightness fluctuations detected by the Kepler Spacecraft and subsequent ground based observations. Possible
explanations for the dips in the photometric measurements include interstellar or circumstellar dust,
and it has been speculated that an artificial megastructure could be responsible. We analyze 177 highresolution spectra of Boyajian’s Star in an effort to detect potential laser signals from extraterrestrial
civilizations. The spectra were obtained by the Lick Observatory’s Automated Planet Finder telescope
as part of the Breakthrough Listen Project, and cover the wavelength range of visible light from 374
to 970 nm. We calculate that the APF would be capable of detecting lasers of power greater than
approximately 24 MW at the distance of Boyajian’s Star, d = 1470 ly. The top candidates from the
analysis can all be explained as either cosmic ray hits, stellar emission lines or atmospheric air glow
emission lines.
